    "appearance":"Depressions on the surface of the molded part.",
    "cause":"Sink marks are always produced in regions of accumulation of material when the contraction in volume arising during the cooling phase cannot be adequately compensated for by the holding pressure.",
    "correction":"Avoid large differences in wall thickness and accumulations of material (e.g. by means of rib structures having large radii, fixing domes, etc.); a rib thickness of 0.5 - 0.7 times the basic wall thickness is advantageous.<br/>Check for correct temperature control.<br/>Optimize melt and mold temperature; set the holding pressure, holding pressure time and melt cushion to adequate dimensions (increase values).<br/>Gate at the greatest wall thickness;design the sprue and gate cross sections in keeping with the material and molded part.<br/>Cool thick-walled parts in cold water (freezing of the peripheral layer) in order to shorten the setting time.<br/>Check screw valve design and condition.",
